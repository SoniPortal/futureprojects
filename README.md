# futureprojects
these are my future projects that i may make

## list
* floppy cube simulator ported from my old python project to processing (graphical instead of text)
* rubik's rings/hungarian rings simulator
* a barcode generator (using code 93 because i know how that works)
* rubik's cube solver? (probably using beginner's method though)
