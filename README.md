# futureprojects
these are my future projects that i may make

## list
* password generator (including diceware)
* floppy cube simulator ported from my old python project to processing (graphical instead of text)
* rubik's rings/hungarian rings simulator
* a barcode generator (using code 93 because i know how that works)
* a little processing thing that's basically a cat program for the microphone (input goes to output) for my bass
* rubik's cube solver? (probably using beginner's method though)
